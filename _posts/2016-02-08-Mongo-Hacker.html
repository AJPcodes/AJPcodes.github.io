blurb: How to get Mongo Hacker in the Mongo Shell for windows
---
<p>So I was watching a team treehouse introductory MongoDB tutorial, and wanted to follow along with some of the mongo-hacker added commands. If I were in a Mac environment, that would have been as simple as an NPM install. I'm working in Windows, though so it turned into a it more of a project.</p>
<p>Luckily. I found a <a target="blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14993096/is-there-any-mongo-shell-extensions-for-windows">great article on Stack Overflow</a> The solution ended up being to grab a zip file of the Mongo Hacker files, concatenating all of the Mongo Hacker <a href="https://github.com/TylerBrock/mongo-hacker/tree/master/hacks" target="blank">'Hacks'</a> js files, and pasting them below the config.js files into a .mongorc.js file. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have fun.</p>
<p>Happy coding</p>
