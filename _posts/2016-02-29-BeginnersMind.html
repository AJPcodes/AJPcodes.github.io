blurb: Thoughts on Zen and programming.

<p>
I practice Zen meditation at Nashville Zen Center, and wanted to outline a Zen concept that I believe is helpful day to day as I continue to study programming.
</p>
<h3>Beginner's Mind</h3>
<p>
  Zen teaches that the root of all suffering is delusion. We separate ourselves from reality through layers of conscious and unconscious interpretation and then get upset when reality fails to conform to our expectations. The practice of Zen meditation, in theory, improves awareness of our mental layers interpretation until we can set them aside and experience reality as-is, unencumbered by our own delusions. Approaching anything with a 'beginner's mind' means to try to not bring too much of our set mental baggage. Knowledge and experience are useful, but not when they crowd out new possibilities.
</p>
<p>A zen master once has tea with a man who was convinced he has obtained enlightenment. The man continued to talk about his insights and understanding while the master poured tea into his cup until it overflowed. A full glass cannot contain anything new. There has to be some space.</p>

  So what can be gained from a beginner's mind?  Having a beginner's mind can help avoid frustration and keep you open to finding creative solutions to problems. The less rigid your expectations are about how a problem should be solved, the more open you are to trying ideas that may not be how you expected to solve a problem. If you approach learning with a sense of curiosity, rather than a set expectations, things that don't work exactly how you expected become sources of infromation and curiosity, rather than points of frustration. Realistically, living in the present is not only difficult, but our filters and learned thought patterns are extremely useful, so make the most of what you've learned. Just be sure you leave some room for your beginner's mind to absorb new information.
